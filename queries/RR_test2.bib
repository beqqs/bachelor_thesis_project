The performance of this process is the result of a complex interaction between several devices, some of which exhibit random behaviour. We use probabilistic model checking and, in particular, the tool PRISM to compute the best- and worst-case performance of device discovery: the expected time for the process to complete and the expected power consumption. We illustrate the utility of performing an exhaustive, low-level analysis to produce exact results in contrast to simulation techniques, where additional probabilistic assumptions must be made. We demonstrate an example of how seemingly innocuous assumptions can lead to incorrect performance estimations. We also analyse the effectiveness of improvements made between versions 1.1 and 1.2 of the Bluetooth specification.}}

We formalise probabilistic refinement of action systems [3] in order to provide just such a front end, and we illustrate with the probabilistic model checker PRISM [21] how it can be used to reduce state explosion. The case study is based on a performance analysis of randomised backoff in wireless communication [1].}}

The main contribution of this paper is an initial step towards verifying the correctness of WSN applications with a focus on concurrency.

Indeed, the communications were mainly cabled and handled by Ethernet protocols. The evolution of avionics embedded systems and the number of integrated functions in civilian aircrafts has changed the situation. Indeed, those functionalities implies a huge increase in the quantity of data exchanged and thus in the number of connections between functions. Among the available mechanisms provided to handle this new complexity, one find Avionics Full Duplex Switched Ethernet (AFDX), a protocol that allows to simulate a point-to-point network between a source and one or more destinations. The core idea in AFDX is the one of Virtual Links (VL) that are used to simulate point-to-point communication between devices. One of the main challenge is to show that the total delivery time for packets on VL is bounded by some predefined value. This is a difficult problem that also requires to provide a formal, but quite evolutive, model of the AFDX network. In this paper, we propose to use a component-based design methodology to describe the behavior of the model. We then propose a stochastic abstraction that allows not only to simplify the complexity of the verification process but also to provide quantitative information on the protocol.}}

Its medium access control mechanism is described according to a variant of the Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) scheme. Although collisions cannot always be prevented, randomised exponential backoff rules are used in the retransmission scheme to minimise the likelihood of repeated collisions. More precisely, the backoff procedure involves a uniform probabilistic choice of an integer-valued delay from an interval, where the size of the interval grows exponentially with regard to the number of retransmissions of the current data packet. We model the two-way handshake mechanism of the IEEE 802.11 standard with a fixed network topology using probabilistic timed automata, a formal description mechanism in which both nondeterministic choice and probabilistic choice can be represented. From our probabilistic timed automaton model, we obtain a finite-state Markov decision process via a property-preserving discrete-time semantics. The Markov decision process is then verified using Prism, a probabilistic model checking tool, against probabilistic, timed properties such as "at most 5,000 microseconds pass before a station sends its packet correctly."}}

The open and distributed nature of these communications implies that the communication medium is no longer completely controlled by the communicating parties. As a result, there has been an increasing demand for research in establishing secure communications over insecure networks, by means of security protocols. In this thesis, a formal model for the description and analysis of security protocols at the process level is developed. At this level, under the assumption of perfect cryptography, the analysis focusses on detecting aws and vulnerabilities of the security protocol. Starting from ??rst principles, operational semantics are developed to describe security protocols and their behaviour. The resulting model is parameterized, and can e.g. capture various intruder models, ranging from a secure network with no intruder, to the strongest intruder model known in literature. Within the security protocol model various security properties are de??ned, such as secrecy and various forms of authentication. A number of new results about these properties are formulated and proven correct. Based on the model, an automated veri??cation procedure is developed, which signi ??cantly improves over existing methods. The procedure is implemented in a prototype, which outperforms other tools. Both the theory and tool are applied in two novel case studies. Using the tool prototype, new results are established in the area of protocol composition, leading to the discovery of a class of previously undetected attacks. Furthermore, a new protocol in the area of multiparty authentication is developed. The resulting protocol is proven correct within the framework.}}

We show that our Bayesian approach outperforms current statistical Model Checking techniques, which rely on tests from Classical (aka Frequentist) statistics, by requiring fewer system simulations. Another advantage of our approach is the ability to incorporate prior Biological knowledge about the model being verified. We demonstrate our algorithm on a variety of models from the Systems Biology literature and show that it enables faster verification than state-of-the-art techniques, even when no prior knowledge is available.}}

It has the features of both the Internet and the Telecommunications Network, and also has its own distinguishing feature. Through analysing the current accepted three-layer structure of the Internet of things, we suggest that the three-layer structure can't express the whole features and connotation of the Internet of Things. After reanalysing the technical framework of the Internet and the Logical Layered Architecture of the Telecommunication Management Network, we establish new five-layer architecture of the Internet of Things. We believe this architecture is more helpful to understand the essence of the Internet of Things, and we hope it is helpful to develop the Internet of Things.}}

Since the amount of sensing data may be large and sensor nodes are usually battery-powered, it is critical to design energy-efficient routing algorithms to prolong network lifetime. Given a certain sensor deployment, the routing strategy of sensor data would have profound effects on the communication cost. In this paper, based on low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) series protocols which are low-energy consumption adaptive clustering routing protocols, we propose the OVSF mechanism based routing protocol and EERPP (Energy-Efficient Routing Protocol based on Priority). Simulation results of OVSF mechanism based protocol and EERPP demonstrate a significant improvement on the network metrics such as the lifetime and the end-to-end delay.}}

For these training-required methods, a small number of training samples always result in poor or user-independent performance, while a large quantity of training samples lead to time-consuming and laborious sample collection processes. In this paper, a high-performance training-free approach for hand gesture recognition with accelerometer is proposed. First, we determine the underlining space for gesture generation with the physical meaning of acceleration direction. Then, the template of each gesture in the underlining space can be generated from the gesture trails, which are frequently provided in the instructions of gesture recognition devices. Thus, during the gesture template generation process, the algorithm does not require training samples any more and fulfills training-free gesture recognition. After that, a feature extraction method, which transforms the original acceleration sequence into a sequence of more user-invariant features in the underlining space, and a more robust template matching method, which is based on dynamic programming, are presented to finish the gesture recognition process and enhance the system performance. Our algorithm is tested in a 28-user experiment with 2,240 gesture samples and this training-free algorithm shows better performance than the traditional training-required algorithms of Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW).}}

Many applications of sensor network such as vehicle tracking and environmental monitoring require joining sensor data scattered over the network. The main performance criterion for queries in a sensor network is to minimize the battery power consumption in each sensor node. Hence, reducing the communication cost of shipping data among sensor nodes is important since it is the main consumer of battery power. In this paper, we propose a technique for join queries in a sensor network that minimizes communication cost. For storage of sensor data, we use a column-oriented database that stores data on disk (or in memory) column-by-column unlike traditional database that store data in rows. The justification for using a column-oriented database technique is not to ship those data columns that do not participate in the actual join. We compare our algorithm with existing join algorithms for sensor networks that are based on traditional row-oriented databases. The performance analysis show that our proposed algorithm based on column-oriented databases outperforms existing algorithms in processing binary equi-join (BEJ) queries for sensor networks.}}

However, little practical progress has been made in the setting of probabilistic verification. In this paper we present a novel abstraction-refinement framework for Markov decision processes (MDPs), which are widely used for modelling and verifying systems that exhibit both probabilistic and nondeterministic behaviour. Our framework comprises an abstraction approach based on stochastic two-player games, two refinement methods and an efficient algorithm for an abstraction-refinement loop. The key idea behind the abstraction approach is to maintain a separation between nondeterminism present in the original MDP and nondeterminism introduced during the abstraction process, each type being represented by a different player in the game. Crucially, this allows lower and upper bounds to be computed for the values of reachability properties of the MDP. These give a quantitative measure of the quality of the abstraction and form the basis of the corresponding refinement methods. We describe a prototype implementation of our framework and present experimental results demonstrating automatic generation of compact, yet precise, abstractions for a large selection of real-world case studies.}}

Automatic recognition of human motion, gestures, and activities is studied in several contexts. For example, mobile computing technology is being considered as a replacement of traditional input systems. Moreover, body posture and activity monitoring can be used for entertainment and health-care applications. However, until now, little work has been done to develop flexible and efficient WBASN solutions suitable for a wide range of applications. Their requirements pose new challenges for sensor network designs, such as optimizing traditional solutions for use as environmental monitoring-like applications and developing on-the-field stress tests. In this paper, we demonstrate the flexibility of a custom-designed WBASN called WiMoCA with respect to a wide range of posture and activity recognition applications by means of practical implementation and on-the-field testing. Nodes of the network mounted on different parts of the human body exploit tri-axial accelerometers to detect its movements. The advanced digital Micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) based inertial sensor has been chosen for WiMoCA because it demonstrated high flexibility of use in many different situations, providing the chance to exploit both static and dynamic acceleration components for different purposes. Furthermore, the sensibility and accuracy of the sensing element is perfectly adequate for monitoring human movement, while keeping cost low and size compact, thus meeting our requirements. We implemented three types of applications, stressing the WBASN in many aspects. In fact, they are characterized by different requirements in terms of accuracy, timeliness, and computation distributed on sensing nodes. For each application, we describe its implementation, and we discuss results about performance and power consumption.}}

This paradigm has opened the Service Cloud to a variety of wireless devices especially those with sensorial and actuating capabilities. Those pervasive networks contribute to build new context-aware applications that interpret the state of the physical world at real-time. However, traditional Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA), which are widely used in the current Internet are unsuitable for such resource-constraint devices since they are too heavy. In this research paper, an internetworking approach is proposed in order to address that important issue. The main part of our proposal is the Knowledge-Aware and Service-Oriented (KASO) Middleware that has been designed for pervasive embedded networks. KASO Middleware implements a diversity of mechanisms, services and protocols which enable developers and business processing designers to deploy, expose, discover, compose, and orchestrate real-world services (i.e. services running on sensor/actuator devices). Moreover, KASO Middleware implements endpoints to offer those services to the Cloud in a REST manner. Our internetworking approach has been validated through a real healthcare telemonitoring system deployed in a sanatorium. The validation tests show that KASO Middleware successfully brings pervasive embedded networks to the Service Cloud.}}

There are a number of technical challenges associated with their operation. These are addressed in part by emerging protocols which attempt to make trade-offs between the various network phenomena in order to optimise overall performance relative to an intended application. Central to the protocol design process is the availability of rigorous tools and techniques for quantifying any putative performance advantage gained by a particular protocol, and the degree to which its use degrades overall network functionality. The tools performing this important task today are simulators but the results from them are often not realistic as they have not been validated against empirical data (D. Cavin et al.). In this paper we explore the benefits of a formal approach to the analysis of wireless networks; in particular we investigate how a careful mix of model checking and proof may be used both to validate design decisions, and to provide a full profile of quantitative performance-style behaviours. Moreover the counterexample facility of model checking can illustrate clearly the limitations of some standard protocols. We demonstrate the methods on flooding and communications protocols.}}

In this paper, we investigate an emerging class of distributed systems where low-level communication does not rely on network topological location. Rather, low-level communication is based on attributes that are external to the network topology and relevant to the application. When combined with dense deployment of nodes, this kind of named data enables in-network processing for data aggregation, collaborative signal processing, and similar problems. These approaches are essential for emerging applications such as sensor networks where resources such as bandwidth and energy are limited. This paper is the first description of the software architecture that supports named data and in-network processing in an operational, multi-application sensor-network. We show that approaches such as in-network aggregation and nested queries can significantly affect network traffic. In one experiment aggregation reduces traffic by up to 42% and nested queries reduce loss rates by 30%. Although aggregation has been previously studied in simulation, this paper demonstrates nested queries as another form of in-network processing, and it presents the first evaluation of these approaches over an operational testbed.}}

Recent experimental studies have shown that real deployments have a "transitional region" with highly unreliable links, and that therefore the idealized perfect-reception-within-range models used in common network simulation tools can be very misleading. In this paper, we use mathematical techniques from communication theory to model and analyze the low power wireless links. The primary contribution of this work is the identification of the causes of the transitional region, and a quantification of their influence. Specifically, we derive expressions for the packet reception rate as a function of distance, and for the width of the transitional region. These expressions incorporate important channel and radio parameters such as the path loss exponent and shadowing variance of the channel; and the modulation and encoding of the radio. A key finding is that for radios using narrow-band modulation, the transitional region is not an artifact of the radio non-ideality, as it would exist even with perfect-threshold receivers because of multi-path fading. However, we hypothesize that radios with mechanisms to combat multi-path effects, such as spread-spectrum and diversity techniques, can reduce the transitional region.}}

Previously proposed geographic routing protocols commonly employ a maximum-distance greedy forwarding technique that works well in ideal conditions. However, such a forwarding technique performs poorly in realistic conditions as it tends to forward packets on lossy links. We identify and illustrate this weak-link problem and the related distance-hop trade-off, whereby energy efficient geographic forwarding must strike a balance between shorter, high-quality links, and longer lossy links. The study is done for scenarios with and without automatic repeat request (ARQ).   Based on an analytical link loss model, we study the distance-hop trade-off via mathematical analysis and extensive simulations of a wide array of blacklisting/link-selection strategies; we also validate some strategies using a set of real experiments on motes. Our analysis, simulations and experiments all show that the product of the packet reception rate (PRR) and the distance traversed towards destination is the optimal forwarding metric for the ARQ case, and is a good metric even without ARQ. Nodes using this metric often take advantage of neighbors in the transitional region (high-variance links). Our results also show that reception-based forwarding strategies are more efficient than purely distance-based strategies; relative blacklisting schemes reduce disconnections and achieve higher delivery rates than absolute blacklisting schemes; and that ARQ schemes become more important in larger networks.}}

Some of these additional attacks have already been considered by Krawczyk [12]. In an attempt to bring these attacks within the scope of the security model we extend the Canetti-Krawczyk model for AKE security by providing significantly greater powers to the adversary.

In such systems, modeling the state of the entire system as a cross-product of the states of individual nodes results in the well-known state explosion problem. Instead, we represent the system state by the probability distribution on the state of each node. In other words, the system state represents the probability that a randomly picked node is in a certain state. Although such statistical abstraction of the global state loses some information, it is nevertheless useful in determining many performance metrics of systems that exhibit Markov behavior. We have previously developed a method for specifying the performance metrics of such systems in a probabilistic temporal logic called iLTL and for evaluating the behavior through a novel method for model checking iLTL properties. In this paper, we describe a method for estimating the probabilities in a Discrete Time Markov Chain (DTMC) model of a large-scale system. We also provide a statistical test so that we can reject estimated DTMCs if the actual system does not have Markov behavior. We describe results of experiments applying our method toWSNs in an experimental test-bed, as well as using simulations. The results of our experiments suggest that our model estimation and model checking method provides a systematic, precise and easy way of evaluating performance metrics of some large-scale WSNs.}}

As our systems communicate more and more with others that we know less and less, they become increasingly vulnerable to hostile intruders who may take advantage of the very protocols intended for the establishment and authentication of communication to tie up our resources and disable our servers. Since these attacks occur before parties are authenticated to each other we cannot rely upon enforcement of the appropriate access control policy to protect us. Instead we must build our defenses, as much as possible, into the protocols themselves.

Lacking implementation details, consumers are under-informed on the security aptitude of their installed distributed sensing and actuating systems. While the Physical (PHY) and Medium Access Control (MAC) layers of the protocol have been made public, details regarding the network layer are not available for analysis. Using a real-world Z-Wave network, the frame forwarding and topology management aspects of the Z-Wave routing protocol are reverse engineered. A security analysis is also performed on the network under study to identify source and data integrity vulnerabilities of the routing protocol. It is discovered that the topology and routes may be modified by an outsider through the exploitation of the blind trust inherent to the routing nodes of the network. A Black Hole attack is conducted on a real-world Z-Wave network to demonstrate a well-known routing attack that exploits the exposed vulnerabilities. As a result of the discoveries, several recommendations are made to enhance the security of the routing protocol.}}

In this context security is of pivotal importance, as IoT constitutes a pervasive network of devices highly integrated with our daily life. In this paper we examine key security issues of the procedure used in LoRaWAN to allow an end device to establish a connection with the network server. We have identified vulnerabilities in this protocol, in particular with reference to the use of a random number in the join procedure packet, meant to prevent replay attacks. We first discuss the options that a network server has when detecting a replay attack and then we examine a) the possibility that a legitimate receiver is considered an attacker because of the random number generation issues and b) the possibility for an attacker to exploit this protocol to generate a denial of service (DoS). A wide set of experiments has been conducted using a widely used LoRaWAN chip showing the vulnerabilities of the protocol.}}

Methods/Statistical Analysis: For verification of system like ZigBee protocol stack, formal methods are being used. The latest formal verification method called Event-B is used now a day to frame a model for verification of different wireless security protocols like IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.15.4. Findings: To describe specific properties in a suitably rich mathematical logic such as first order logic, we need to limit this expressiveness if we are to automatically verify a property. To verify any system properties, temporal logic are used for safety, correctness, reliability in wireless security protocols. In this paper we developed a model/ framework in Event-B for the formal verification of ZigBee protocol and simulate it using RODIN tool. In this framework, models are specified, analyzed and verified by using formal methods.

We adopt the management framework of industry consortium THREAD, where a group of devices cooperating to accomplish the same task (called policy) are administrated by a designated device called commissioner and together they form a policy group. All these policy groups are further managed by a centralized server. In this hierarchical network structure, the secure distribution of the policy information, access control, and group key from the centralized server to commissioner and its peers become challenging given the pervasive, complex and heterogeneous properties of devices. To solve this, we propose protocols/mechanisms along with a variant of Broadcast Encryption called Secure Identity-Based Broadcast Encryption (SIBBE) and demonstrate the feasibility for secure distribution of information to the IoT devices from centralized server.

However, the deployed Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) protocol suffers from several security and performance weaknesses, such as, user identity disclosing, high authentication delay and bandwidth consumption. All these, impact negatively the handover process and the quality of service. The new 5G network technology will utilize a basic 5G access authentication similar to the current 4G/LTE platform. This new technology creates novel security challenges that the next generation of AKA must support.

Although the standard has specified some issues of security and mobility in 6LoWPANs, the issues of supporting secure group handovers have not been addressed much by the currently existing solutions. To further reduce the handover latency and signaling overhead, a fast group authentication scheme is proposed in this paper to support secure and seamless handovers for multiple resource constrained 6LoWPAN devices.

The security analysis and the performance evaluation show that the proposed 6LoWPAN group handover scheme could enhance the security functionalities with high efficiency to achieve a fast authentication for handovers.}}

The emergence of intelligent devices has led to a paradigm shift in the way technology interacts with the environment, leading society to a smarter planet. Consequently, new advanced telemetry approaches appear to connect all kinds of devices with each other, with companies, or with other networks, such as the Internet. On the road to an increasingly interconnected world, where critical devices rely on communication networks to provide an essential service, there arises the need to ensure the security and reliability of these protocols and applications. In this paper, we discuss a security-based approach for MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport), which stands out as a very lightweight and widely used messaging and information exchange protocol for IoT (Internet of Things) devices throughout the world. To that end, we propose the creation of a framework that allows for performing a novel, template-based fuzzing technique on the MQTT protocol. The first experimental results showed that performance of the fuzzing technique presented here makes it a good candidate for use in network architectures with low processing power sensors, such as Smart Cities. In addition, the use of this fuzzer in widely used applications that implement MQTT has led to the discovery of several new security flaws not hitherto reported, demonstrating its usefulness as a tool for finding security vulnerabilities.}}

Probabilistic model checking aims to establish the correctness of probabilistic system models against quantitative probabilistic specifications, such as those capable of expressing, for example, the probability of an unsafe event occurring, expected time to termination, or expected power consumption in the start-up phase. In this chapter, we present the foundations of probabilistic model checking, focusing on finite-state Markov decision processes as models and quantitative properties expressed in probabilistic temporal logic. Markov decision processes can be thought of as a probabilistic variant of labelled transition systems in the following sense: transitions are labelled with actions, which can be chosen nondeterministically, and successor states for the chosen action are specified by means of discrete probabilistic distributions, thus specifying the probability of transiting to each successor state. To reason about expectations, we additionally annotate Markov decision processes with quantitative costs, which are incurred upon taking the selected action from a given state. Quantitative properties are expressed as formulas of the probabilistic computation tree logic (PCTL) or using linear temporal logic (LTL). We summarise the main model-checking algorithms for both PCTL and LTL, and illustrate their working through examples. The chapter ends with a brief overview of extensions to more expressive models and temporal logics, existing probabilistic model-checking tool support, and main application domains.}}

As the majority of devices in IoT are battery operated, their applications should be facilitated with a low-power communication setup. Such facility is possible through the Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN), but at a constrained bit rate. For long-range communication over LPWAN, several approaches and protocols are adopted. One such protocol is the Long-Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN), which is a media access layer protocol for long-range communication between the devices and the application servers via LPWAN gateways. However, LoRaWAN comes with fewer security features as a much-secured protocol consumes more battery because of the exorbitant computational overheads. The standard protocol fails to support end-to-end security and perfect forward secrecy while being vulnerable to the replay attack that makes LoRaWAN limited in supporting applications where security (especially end-to-end security) is important. Motivated by this, an enhanced LoRaWAN security protocol is proposed, which not only provides the basic functions of connectivity between the application server and the end device, but additionally averts these listed security issues. The proposed protocol is developed with two options, the Default Option (DO) and the Security-Enhanced Option (SEO). The protocol is validated through Burrows–Abadi–Needham (BAN) logic and the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool. The proposed protocol is also analyzed for overheads through system-based and low-power device-based evaluations. Further, a case study on a smart factory-enabled parking system is considered for its practical application. The results, in terms of network latency with reliability fitting and signaling overheads, show paramount improvements and better performance for the proposed protocol compared with the two handshake options, Pre-Shared Key (PSK) and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), of Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS).}}

In this work, we present a formal study of LoRaWAN security, an increasingly popular technology, which defines the structure and operation of LPWAN networks based on the LoRa physical layer. There are previously known security vulnerabilities in LoRaWAN that lead to the proposal of several improvements, some already incorporated into the latest protocol specification. Our analysis of LoRaWAN security uses Scyther, a formal security analysis tool and focuses on the key exchange portion of versions 1.0 (released in 2015) and 1.1 (the latest, released in 2017). For version 1.0, which is still the most widely deployed version of LoRaWAN, we show that our formal model allowed to uncover weaknesses that can be related to previously reported vulnerabilities. Our model did not find weaknesses in the latest version of the protocol (v1.1), and we discuss what this means in practice for the security of LoRaWAN as well as important aspects of our model and tools employed that should be considered. The Scyther model developed provides realistic models for LoRaWAN v1.0 and v1.1 that can be used and extended to formally analyze, inspect, and explore the security features of the protocols. This, in turn, can clarify the methodology for achieving secrecy, integrity, and authentication for designers and developers interested in these LPWAN standards. We believe that our model and discussion of the protocols security properties are beneficial for both researchers and practitioners. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that presents a formal security analysis of LoRaWAN.}}

In order to overcome this issue, it is required to perform verification at early stage of development. For this purpose, formal methods are widely used to verify the software and hardware design mathematically through different formalisms. Timed Automata (TA) is a renowned formalism commonly used for the verification of real time embedded systems. Verification of time related aspects adds addition complexity; therefore, it is always challenging to select right verification tool for timed automata formalism. This article presents a comprehensive investigation of two leading formal verification tools i.e. PRISM and UPPAAL using timed automata. Particularly, a benchmark case study is used to perform modeling and verification in both tools keeping in mind few evaluation parameters. The results reveal that UPPAAL is more flexible in terms of usability and easiness. On the other hand, PRISM provides good features for probabilistic models. Finally, it is analyzed that UPPAAL overall performs well.}}

An alternate approach is to shrink the attack surface in order to reduce the threat of attack. This would require that the device undergo more stringent security tests before deployment. Formal verification is a promising tool that can be used to not only detect potential vulnerabilities but also provide guarantees of security. This chapter reviews several security issues that plague IoT devices such as functional correctness of implementations, programming bugs, side-channel analysis, and hardware Trojans. In each of these cases, we discuss state-of-the-art mechanisms that use formal verification tools to detect the vulnerability much before the device is deployed.}}

The model represents synchronous and asynchronous components in a uniform framework that supports compositional (assume-guarantee) and hierarchical (stepwise-refinement) design and verification. While synchronous models are based on a notion of atomic computation step, and asynchronous models remove that notion by introducing stuttering, our model is based on a flexible notion of what constitutes a computation step: by applying an abstraction operator to a system, arbitrarily many consecutive steps can be collapsed into a single step. The abstraction operator, which may turn an asynchronous system into a synchronous one, allows us to describe systems at various levels of temporal detail. For describing systems at various levels of spatial detail, we use a hiding operator that may turn a synchronous system into an asynchronous one. We illustrate the model with diverse examples from synchronous circuits, asynchronous shared-memory programs, and synchronous message-passing protocols.}}

The home automation and entertainment (HAE) systems often make use of Bluetooth technology to link different Bluetooth devices and form Bluetooth networks. The security concerns of the HAE systems are raised due to massive deployment of the Bluetooth devices. The Bluetooth standard mainly depends on the secure simple pairing (SSP) solution to protect the Bluetooth devices. Hence, we investigate the SSP solution according to the Bluetooth standard v5.0. The contributions are threefold. (1) A formal security model is proposed to evaluate SSP’s association models and authenticated link key. (2) We formally analyze two SSP protocols and present the security requirements for basic cryptographic modules in these SSP protocols. (3) We discuss the typical SSP applications in the HAE systems. Our results are useful to not only evaluating and designing the SSP protocols but also enhancing the security of the HAE systems in which the Bluetooth access is available.}}

It uses authenticated Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman for its key exchange. In this paper we show that the authentication provided by the Bluetooth pairing protocols is insufficient and does not provide the promised MitM protection. We present a new attack that modifies the y-coordinates of the public keys (while preserving the x-coordinates). The attack compromises the encryption keys of all of the current Bluetooth authenticated pairing protocols, provided both paired devices are vulnerable. Specifically, it successfully compromises the encryption keys of 50% of the Bluetooth pairing attempts, while in the other 50% the pairing of the victims is terminated. The affected vendors have been informed and patched their products accordingly, and the Bluetooth specification had been modified to address the new attack. We named our new attack the “Fixed Coordinate Invalid Curve Attack”. Unlike the well known “Invalid Curve Attack” of Biehl et al. [2] which recovers the private key by sending multiple specially crafted points to the victim, our attack is a MitM attack which modifies the public keys in a way that lets the attacker deduce the shared secret.}}

The attack allows a third party, without knowledge of any secret material (such as link and encryption keys), to make two (or more) victims agree on an encryption key with only 1 byte (8 bits) of entropy. Such low entropy enables the attacker to easily brute force the negotiated encryption keys, decrypt the eavesdropped ciphertext, and inject valid encrypted messages (in real-time). The attack is stealthy because the encryption key negotiation is transparent to the Bluetooth users. The attack is standard-compliant because all Bluetooth BR/EDR versions require to support encryption keys with entropy between 1 and 16 bytes and do not secure the key negotiation protocol. As a result, the attacker completely breaks Bluetooth BR/EDR security without being detected. We call our attack Key Negotiation Of Bluetooth (KNOB) attack.

The attack targets the firmware of the Bluetooth chip because the firmware (Bluetooth controller) implements all the security features of Bluetooth BR/EDR. As a standard-compliant attack, it is expected to be effective on any firmware that follows the specification and on any device using a vulnerable firmware. We describe how to perform the KNOB attack, and we implement it. We evaluate our implementation on more than 14 Bluetooth chips from popular manufacturers such as Intel, Broadcom, Apple, and Qualcomm. Our results demonstrate that all tested devices are vulnerable to the KNOB attack. We discuss countermeasures to fix the Bluetooth specification and its implementation.}}

the globe. Ensuring the security of 5G communication is of the utmost importance, building trust in a critical component of everyday life and national infrastructure.

We perform fine-grained formal analysis of 5G’s main authentication and key agreement protocol (AKA), and provide
the first models to explicitly consider all parties defined by the protocol specification. Our analysis reveals that the security of 5G-AKA critically relies on unstated assumptions on the inner workings of the underlying channels. In practice this means that following the 5G-AKA specification, a provider can easily and ‘correctly’ implement the standard insecurely, leaving the protocol vulnerable to a security-critical race condition. We provide the first models and analysis considering component and channel compromise in 5G, whose results further demonstrate the fragility and subtle trust assumptions of the 5G-AKA protocol.

We propose formally verified fixes to the encountered issues, and have worked with 3GPP to ensure these fixes are adopted.}}

We observe that there are several families of attacks on AKE protocols that lie outside the boundary of the current class of security definitions. In an attempt to bring these attacks within the scope of analysis we extend the AKE security definition to provide greater powers to the adversary. We provide a general framework for defining AKE security, which we call strong AKE security, such that existing security definitions occur as instances of the framework. We then introduce NAXOS, a new two-pass AKE protocol, and prove that it is secure in this stronger definition. In addition, we formulate a notion of ephemeral secret key which captures all ephemeral information used in session establishment. We demonstrate the importance of this formulation by showing that a secure AKE protocol SIG-DH can become vulnerable when instantiated with signature schemes which are insecure against revelation of the secret random bits used in the signature generation.}}

Consequently, the aspect of communication security traditionally remains a secondary matter, even though the potential harm of a successful hacker attack can be enormous. Therefore, this paper presents an analysis of LP-WAN vulnerabilities, as well as several Proof-of-Concept (PoC) attacks toward LoRaWAN (packet forging), Sigfox (replay with DoS) and NB-IoT (attack using malicious UE), that confirm the existence of the vulnerabilities in both the standards and off-the-shelf hardware and services.}}

Next, we modify the 5G-AKA protocol to prevent these attacks, while satisfying 5G-AKA efficiency constraints as much as possible. We then formally prove that our protocol is sigma-unlinkable.
